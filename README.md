==========

Web frontend for the citrus continuous integration tool

# Development

It uses [Coffee toaster](https://github.com/serpentem/coffee-toaster) for CoffeeScript compilation and dependency management.

Run 'toaster -wd' locally to launch the automatic compilation.

You may need to change the toaster.coffee to reflect how are the files accessed by the browser.
